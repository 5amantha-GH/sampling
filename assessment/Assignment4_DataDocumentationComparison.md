## Why am I doing this assignment?

This assignment supports learning outcomes 1, 2, 3, and 4:
	1.	Develop ability to implement simple probability samples.
	2.	Understand more complicated sampling procedures and the tradeoffs involved.
	3.	Identify and understand sources of error or inaccuracies in data as a result of sampling strategies.
	4.	Develop intuition around survey quality.

## Rubric

-	All required components are present and complete, including citation of specific sources **Pass / Fail**
-	Survey and sample features of the 3 surveys are correctly identified in the table provided, using evidence or justification from original sources **Pass / Fail**
