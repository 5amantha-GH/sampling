# Learning Outcomes

- Ability to implement simple probability samples.
- Ability to understand more complicated sampling procedures and the tradeoffs involved.
- Ability to identify and understand sources of error or inaccuracies in data as a result of sampling strategies.
- Development of intuition around survey quality.

# Foundations of Probability (level: Beginner)

- *How do we calculate and interpret probabilities? What is a statistical distribution?*
  - Foundations
  - Distributions
  - Random variables
- Reference: Pitman, 1993, *Probability* , Springer, Chapters 1-3

---

# Populations, Censuses, Surveys, and Observational data (level: Beginner)

- *Who are you intending to study? Who is receiving your survey or being observed? How will this impact the resulting data and analysis?*
  - Defining a target population and what are the (statistical) units
  - Introduce representative and non-representative sampling and illustrate with examples
  - Differences between censuses, surveys and observational studies with Canadian applications
- Reference: Wu and Thompson, 2020, *Sampling Theory and Practice* , Springer., Chapter 1
