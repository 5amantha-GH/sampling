## Description

The goal of this module is to introduce the essentials of sampling, probability, and survey methodology. This includes simple probability samples, stratified sampling, cluster sampling, dealing with non-response, estimating and survey quality. Students will consider the theoretical foundations of different sampling approaches, as well as practical applications of this knowledge towards contexts such as market research, political polling, and the Canadian census. Analysis using the Python programming language will also be highlighted, drawing on skills developed in previous modules.

## Learning Outcomes
1.	Develop ability to implement simple probability samples.
2.	Understand more complicated sampling procedures and the tradeoffs involved.
3.	Identify and understand sources of error or inaccuracies in data as a result of sampling strategies.
4.	Develop intuition around survey quality.

### Delivery instructions
The course will be held online, four days a week. Each day will be 2.5 hours. Being mindful of online fatigue, there will be one break during each class where students are encouraged to stretch, grab a drink and snacks, or ask any additional questions.

### Technology Requirements
Camera is optional although highly encouraged. We understand that not everyone may have the space at home to have the camera on.

## Marking Scheme and Assignment Submission
Rubrics for each assignment (pass/fail) are included in each assignment document in the 'assessments' folder. Please submit your assignments using the google forms linked in the table below.

## Policies
Questions are encouraged! Extensions for assessments may be granted but the hard deadline for all assessments is April 11, 2024. Please ask for extensions as soon as possible. 

## Late Policy:
Submissions can be submitted late on an as needed basis. The hard deadline for all assessments, however, is April 11, 2024. No assessment will be graded past this date.

## Academic Integrity:
We will indicate when assignments can be collaborative vs. individual. For individual assignments, please write your own solutions. If you use any outside resources, please cite them. Using large language models is discouraged but allowed. We have found that using answers from these are variable at best. Please use your best judgment.

## Folder Structure
Below are the folders contained in this repo with a description of what they contain and information on how to use them.

### 1. *assessment*:
This folder contains the assessments for the workshop. Assignments will be discussed in detail in class.

### 2. *lectures*:
This folder contains the powerpoint files for the slides. 

### 3. *resources-exercises*:
This folder contains additional resources that can help students throughout the workshop, as content is cumulative. Unfortunately, there is not enough time to review previous content each class so while these exercises are **not** graded, they are highly recommended.

### 4. *lesson plans*:
These were used to plan the course but we are not following them exactly so feel free to ignore.
