## Description

The goal of this module is to introduce the essentials of sampling, probability, and survey methodology. This includes simple probability samples, stratified sampling, cluster sampling, dealing with non-response, estimating and survey quality. Students will consider the theoretical foundations of different sampling approaches, as well as practical applications of this knowledge towards contexts such as market research, political polling, and the Canadian census. Analysis using the R programming language will also be highlighted, drawing on skills developed in Module 3.

## Learning Outcomes
Students will know how to:

1. Ability to implement simple probability samples.
2. Ability to understand more complicated sampling procedures and the tradeoffs involved.
3. Ability to identify and understand sources of error or inaccuracies in data as a result of sampling strategies.
4. Development of intuition around survey quality.

### Delivery instructions
The workshop will be held over three weeks, three days a week. Two of the three days will be 2-hours long and the last day will be 3-hours. Being mindful of online fatigue, there will be one break during each class where students are encouraged to stretch, grab a drink and snacks, or ask any additional questions.

### Technology Requirements
1. Camera is optional although highly encouraged. We understand that not everyone may have the space at home to have the camera on.

## Policies
The course is a live-coding class. Students are expected to follow along with the coding, creating files and folders to navigate and manipulate. Students should be active participants while coding and are encouraged to ask questions throughout. Although slides will be available for students to reference, they should be referenced before or after class, as during class will be dedicated to coding with the instructor.

**How to submit assignments, late policy, academic integrity.**

## Folder Structure
Below are the folders contained in this repo with a description of what they contain and information on how to use them.

### 1 *assignments*:
This folder contains the assignments for the workshop. Students are expected to complete them one week after the content has been delivered.

### 2. *homework*:
This folder contains homework for students to practice Unix and Git/GitHub workshops. Please complete the Unix Shell homework in the first week, and the Git/GitHub homework in the second.

There are pdf copies of the homework and markdown files, which can be edited. The homework can change based on the amount of content that was completed each day.

Homework is just a suggestion but will help students throughout the workshop, as content is cumulative and will only get more difficult. Unfortunately, there is not enough time to review previous content each class so while this homework is **not** graded, it is highly recommended.

### 3. *lessons*:
This folder contains the pdf and html version of the slides. Either the pdf slides or the html slides can be used when teaching. If slides are edited to contain any gifs, the instructor will need to use the html slides so that the gifs are active.

pdf slides should be referenced before class to prepare or after class to review. During class will be live-coding, therefore, there is no need to follow them during class. They contain all information that was discussed in class and are a great resource in the future if students need to reassess their knowledge.

### 4. *post-course*:
This folder contains the exit surveys for students to complete. It holds both the md and docx versions of the survey.

### 5. *slides-resources*:
This folder contains all editable slides. To edit, download the entire folder, including the *pics* folder as this folder contains the pictures which are relationally referenced in the markdown files.

To change a photo, edit the markdown where photos are referenced.

Example: 

Change `![w:1150 center](pics/github.png)` to `![bg](pics/github.png)`

To add a photo, add photo to the *pics* folder and reference it within the markdown file.

Example:

Added photo labelled "git_commit.png" will be referenced in markdown file as `![w:1000 left](pics/git_commit.png)`
