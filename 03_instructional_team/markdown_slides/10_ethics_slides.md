# Respondent Burden

---

# Respondent Burden

- **Respondent burden** refers to any risk, inconvenience, or discomfort respondents endure as a result of their participation in a study or survey
  - Low respondent burden: filling out a survey that takes 15 minutes of a participant’s free time
  - High respondent burden: taking an experimental medication with potential negative side effects
- **Net burden** occurs when respondent burden outweighs the personal benefit received for a given respondent
> Total participant burden =  Net burden per participant $\cdot$  Number of participants

---

# Impacts of High Respondent Burden on Data Quality

- Unit or item non-response
  - Respondent may avoid parts of a survey that they feel are most involved, or may avoid responding entirely
- Measurement error
  - Respondents providing rushed or inaccurate answers as a result of feeling overly burdened
- Sustainability
  - Inability to recruit new or repeat respondents once potential participants become aware of the burden involved

---

# Study Value

- **Study value** refers to the projected societal or clinical benefits of the results of a given study
  - Low study value: a survey measuring university students’ opinions on local coffee shops
  - High study value: a clinical trial of a new cancer treatment
- Value can also include benefit to individual participants in the study (i.e. compensation or insight/knowledge)
- Value is sometimes measured in terms of the probability of generating statistically significant results (also known as **statistical power**)

---

# Respondent Burden and Sample Size

- If there is no net burden for each participant, ethical considerations do not need to constrain sample size
- If there is a net burden for each participant, the total burden increases as sample size increases
- However, a larger sample may increase the probability of achieving statistically significant or reliable results, which would increase the study value

**A sample size could be considered ethically acceptable if the projected value of the study is greater than the total participant burden generated by the sample size**

<!-- 
NOTE: This is ethically ACCEPTABLE, not OPTIMAL (study value > total burden is merely an ethical threshold)

# External Validity

---

# Validity

- **Internal validity** refers to the validity of results *within* a particular study
  - Were all relevant variables measured? Were measurements accurate? Is the analysis appropriate for the study design?
- **External validity** describes the extent to which the results of study can be validly applied *outside* of the context of that specific study
  - Are the study participants representative of the target population? Do the conditions of the study mimic real-world conditions?
  - A study must be internally valid in order to be externally valid

---

# Sampling and External Validity

- How can we make sure samples maximize external validity?
  - Reduce selection, coverage, and non-response bias
  - Ensure sample size is sufficiently large
  - Use **probability samples**
    - SRS, stratified samples, cluster samples, etc.
    - Each sampling unit has a known selection probability
    - Representative and minimally biased

---

# Issues with Probability Sampling

- Resource intensive, expensive, and time consuming
- Sample size may be too small to be representative
- Incomplete randomization
  - Sampling units may be randomized, but still all drawn from one location or over a short time frame (i.e. time and place are not random, which impacts selection prob)
- Presence of other errors
  - Measurement error
  - Coverage error (incomplete sampling frame)
  - Low response rate or high non-response bias

---

# Non-probability Sampling

- Becoming more common in social and scientific research
- Generally **easier** and **cheaper** than probability sampling
- **More difficult to analyze**, but more robust analysis and estimation techniques are being developed
- Examples
  - **Convenience sampling**: selecting individuals from accessible populations or allowing individuals to volunteer without explicit selection
  - **Deliberate or purposive sampling**: choosing individuals with specific characteristics (either for diversity or homogeneity)

---

# External Validity and Ethical Concerns

- **Representation**
  - Convenience sampling: Who is the sample convenient for? Is the sample systematically biased towards some populations and away from others?
  - Deliberate sampling: How were individuals with the desired characteristics identified and selected?
- **Estimation and generalizations from non-representative samples**
  - Demographic variation and covariation may go undetected
  - Potential inaccurate results for population-level estimates
  - Potential negative outcomes on populations that were not represented in the sample

---

# Working with Non-Representative Samples

- Consider impacts of bias
  - What are the potential consequences if inference from a non-representative sample is inaccurate?
- Restrict estimates to a subpopulation
  - If your sample only contains people under 30, do not generalize results to people of all age groups
- Weighting methods
  - Post-stratification
  - Raking
- Modelling
  - Multi-level models to extract information from underrepresented sub-populations
