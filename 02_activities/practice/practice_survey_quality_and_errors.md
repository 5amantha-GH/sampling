# Sampling Practice: Survey Quality and Errors


## Questions

1. You administer a 10 question survey to 1000 U of T students. When you analyze your results, you observe that some participants did not answer some questions. Nonresponse seems random, not following any pattern. Is this an example of variance or bias?

2. True or False: Sampling error can be completely avoided when we are taking a representative sample of our target population.

3. Application question: Try to locate scholarly literature or online resources related to sampling work in your field of work. What are acceptable non-response rates in your field? What are standards in your field for documenting and evaluating error? 

4. Let's return to an in-class activity. Our team is doing a survey of Canadian public servants to learn their feelings about AI use in government. We need to present the results to management before they decide the policy for the next ten years. Different members of our team want to prioritize A) Coherence, B) Accessibility, and C) Comparability. For each priority:
	- How could this change the way we plan and implement our survey?
	- What could be some unintended consequences of prioritizing this measure of quality?

5. What survey study design choices could you make to reduce measurement error?



## Answers



1. Variance (random error, we aim to minimize it)

2. False - Sampling error could only be avoided if our sample population was the exact same as our target population.

3. Answers will differ for each person/field. 

4. A range of answers are possible; consult slideshow 07.

5. Write clear questions, test questions and survey administration protocols before implementation, hire good interviewers
